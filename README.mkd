This is a complete example of how to use GLSurfaceView and native code to draw
old-skool pixel buffer graphics on the Android platform.  It is related to this
[blog post][] about the Android NDK.

To compile the code:

    ./prepare-android-build.sh SDK [NDK]
    ant debug

* SDK - path to the SDK (or can be set in `ANDROID_SDK`)
* NDK - path to the NDK. If not given, then assumes the ndk is next to the SDK.
